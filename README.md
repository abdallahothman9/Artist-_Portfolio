Design
I focused on creating a minimalist and elegant design, using a neutral color scheme and clean typography. I also aimed to make the website easy to navigate and visually appealing.

Responsive Design
I ensured that the website is responsive and can be viewed on different devices and screen sizes. I used media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes for smaller screens.

Accessibility
I followed accessibility best practices, such as using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring a logical tab order.

Development Process
I used Git for version control, testing the website on different browsers, and debugging any issues that arose.

Getting Started
To run the website locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine
Open the index.html file in your web browser
Future Plans
In the future, I plan to add more photos and descriptions of my work, as well as optimizing the website's performance.
